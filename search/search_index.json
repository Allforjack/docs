The Automata Witness aims to provide a fully decentralized voting platform where users don't need to worry about their privacy being compromised. In addition, the highly available service aims at a much lower transaction fee to generate new blocks. This page will walk you through the witness page and the functionalities it currently provides. Main page \u00b6 The image in Fig 1-1 shows the landing page of the Automata Witness. In order to access the functionalities provided by Witness, you need first connect to your MetaMask wallet and use an Automata network. If you don't have a MetaMask Wallet installed on your browser say Chrome, this is where you should go in the first place. Fig 1-2 shows the information you need to connect to an Automata network whereas Fig 1-3 directs you to the section where you enter the information. Fig 1-1 Witness main page Fig 1-2 Automata network information Fig 1-3 Steps to connect to Automata Testnet As you can see, there are several workspaces already created. On the top of the page there's a search bar where users can filter workspaces by keyword once the list of workspaces goes longer. Create a new workspace \u00b6 If a user wants to create a new workspace they simply click the Create button in the main page and fill in the required fields as shown in Fig 2-1. Specifically, the contract hash should be obtained through the kovan network. That said, you need to create and deploy your smart contract to be eligible to create a new workspace. Fig 2-1 Create a new workspace Create new proposals \u00b6 Fig 3-1 show the proposals page where you can see existing proposals, active and closed. Fig 3-1 Proposals page On the top of the page you can find a New proposal button that you click to create a new proposal. After clicking it, you'll find the page where you add details to the proposal as shown in Fig 3-2. Fig 3-2 Create a new proposal TODO may need to explain how to determine block height You may also need sufficient fund to create a new proposal. As mentioned earlier, creating a new proposal incurs generating a new block and this is not a free lunch, although we aim to minimize the cost.
