## :robot: B.Protocol

BProtocol aims to shift MEV to users.

Users interact with existing lending platforms via B.Protocol smart contract. Liquidity providers (LP) provide a cushion to user debt, which gives B.Protocol precedence over other liquidators. LPs share their profits with the users, where user reward is proportional to his user rating.

## :robot: CowSwap 

A collaboration between BalancerLabs and Gnosis, CowSwap is a DEX that leverages batch auctions to provide MEV protection, plus integrate with liquidity sources across DEXs to offer traders the best prices. When two traders each hold an asset the other wants, an order can be settled directly between them without an external market maker or liquidity provider. Any excess is settled in the same transaction with the best available AMM. The transaction is sent by professional “solvers” which set tight slippage bounds. Solvers compete with each other to achieve best prices for the user.
