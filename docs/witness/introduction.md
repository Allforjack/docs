# Introduction

Automata Witness is an anonymous voting service for decentralized applications powered by Automata Geode. The Automata Witness aims to provide a fully decentralized voting platform across different blockchain where users don't need to worry about their privacy being compromised. In addition, like other off-chain governance applications, users don't have to pay fees to participate the proposal voting. More importantly, throughout the voting process, user privacy is preserved, including:

* **Voter identity**: Encryption and signing is used to ensure that no one execpt the app running in Geode can know the voter's identity. Also, once the votes are processed, it's discarded and only aggregated voting result is presented to outside of Geode.
* **Vote counts**: The number of votes from each individual voters are not revealed. Instead, only the total number of votes are calculated and presented to determine the wining option.
